# Notepad3

This is a simple text editor for Windows. Basically, it aims to be Notepad, but actually decent like TextEdit for Mac. I was going to call it Notepad2, 
but someone else took that name (Notepad2 hasn't been updated since 2012). Written in C# and .NET.

## Features
1. Rich or plain text editing!
2. All the useful features of Notepad
3. Lightweight
4. Features Notepad's familiar interface.

## How to Download
This isn't functional yet, so no download. Once I have a version, I will publish it in the Releases section.
